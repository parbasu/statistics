    "If the population standard deviation $(\\sigma)$ is known, a hypothesis test performed for one population mean is called **one-mean $z$-test** or simply **$z$-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $z$-test is a hypothesis test for testing a population mean, $\\mu$, against a supposed population mean $\\mu_0$. The $z-$ test assumes normally distributed variables or a large sample size; then the **central limit theorem** guarantees a normally distributed **sampling distribution**. In addition, $\\sigma$, the standard deviation of the population must be known. In real life applications this assumption is almost never fulfilled, and thus, the $z-$ test is rarely applied. However, it is the simplest hypothesis test and thus, a good subject to start with.\n",
    "\n",

They report the mean the average body mass for the European adult population to be $70.8$ *kg*. We set $\\mu_0$, the population mean accordinly, $\\mu_0 = 70.8$. Unfortunately, owing to the methodological approach of Walpole et al. $(2012)$ they did not provide a standard deviation $(\\sigma)$ of the weights of European adults. For demonstration purposes we assume that the weight data given in the *students* data set is a good approximation for the population of interest. Thus, we set $\\sigma$ to the standard deviation of the weight variable in *students* data set."
