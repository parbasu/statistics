    "A very common problem that scientists face is the **assessment of significance** in scattered statistical data. Owing to the limited availability of observational data, scientists apply inferential statistical methods to decide if the observed data contains significant information or if the scattered data is nothing more than the manifestation of the inherently probabilistic nature of the data generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a scientist states such a problems as follows. The scientist builds a model, which is just a simplification of the data generation process, and considers a particular assumption - a so called **hypothesis** - of this model. Given data, he wants to evaluate this tentative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework of hypothesis testing is all about making **statistical inferences about populations based on samples taken from the population**. One way to estimate a population parameter is the construction of confidence intervals. Another way is to make a decision about a parameter in form of a test. Any hypothesis test involves the collection of data (sampling). If the hypothesis is assumed to be correct, the scientist can calculate the expected results of an experiment. If the observed data differs significantly from the expected results, then one considers the assumption to be incorrect. Thus, based on the observed data the scientist makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon analyses of the data, that the model - the hypothesis - should be rejected, or that there is not sufficient evidence to reject the stated hypothesis."

    "**Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential statistics** is all about making decisions or judgments about the value of a particular observation or measurement. One of the most commonly used methods for making such decisions is to perform a **hypothesis test**. A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. In the context of statistical hypothesis tests the term hypothesis is a statement about something that is supposed to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test involves two hypothesis: the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**. The null hypothesis $(H_0)$ is a statement to be tested. The alternative hypothesis $(H_A)$ is a statement that is considered to be an alternative to the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis test is aimed to test if the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The basic logic of a hypothesis test is to compare two statistical data sets. One data set is obtained by sampling and the other data set originates from an idealized model. If the sample data is consistent with the idealized model, the null hypothesis is not rejected; if the sample data is inconsistent with the idealized model and thus, supports an alternative hypothesis, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis involves a so called **test statistic**. The test statistic is a number calculated from the data set, which is obtained by measurements and observations, or more general by sampling.\n",

A type I error occurs if a true null hypothesis is rejected (a “**false positive**”), while a type II error occurs if a false null hypothesis is not rejected (a “**false negative**”). In other words, a type I error is detecting an effect that is not present, while a type II error is failing to detect an effect that is present.\n",

The probability of a type II error (a false null hypothesis is not rejected) is denoted by $\\beta$.

If the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the test statistic is not as extreme as the critical value, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The critical value is computed based on the given significance level $\\alpha$ and the type of probability distribution of the idealized model.
