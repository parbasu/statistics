    "A caveat of ANOVA is that if we reject the null hypothesis we state that the means of the populations under consideration are not all the same. However, we may not decide which particular means are different nor the relation among the means.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with that issue we apply methods called **multiple comparisons.** The problem with multiple comparisons is that more hypotheses are tested on a particular data set, the more likely it is to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. Thus, methods of multiple comparison require a higher significance threshold $(\\alpha)$ for individual comparisons, in order to compensate for the number of inferences being made."

    "\n",
    "Recall that at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the probability of making a Type I error is equal to $0.05$ or $5$%. Consequently, the probability of not making a Type I error is $1- \\alpha = 1-0.05 = 0.95.$ Moreover, the probability of observing two events that are independent is the product of their probabilities. Thus, if we conduct two independent tests, the probability of not making a Type I error on the first and the second tests is\n",
