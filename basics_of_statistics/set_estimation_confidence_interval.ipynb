    "Thus, in a sense, a confidence set is a *set-valued statistic*. A confidence set is an estimator of $\\theta$ in the sense that we hope that $\\theta \\in C(X)$ with high probability, so that the confidence level is high. Note that since the distribution of $X$ depends on $\\theta$, there is a dependence on $\\theta$ in the probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ in the definition of confidence level. However, we usually suppress this, just to keep the notation simple. Usually, we try to construct a confidence set for $\\theta$ with a prescribed confidence level $1-\\alpha$ where $0 < \\alpha < 1$. Typical confidence levels are $0.9,0.95$ and $0.99$. Sometimes the best we can do is to construct a confidence set whose confidence level is *at least* $1-\\alpha$; this is called a **conservative** $1-\\alpha$ confidence set for $\\theta$."

The true value of $\\theta$ is either in this set, or is not, and we usually will never know. However, by the law of large numbers, if we were to repeat the confidence experiment over and over, the proportion of sets that contain $\\theta$ would converge to $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta \\in C(X)] = 1 - \\alpha$. This is the precise meaning of the term **confidence**. In the usual terminology of statistics, the random set $C(X)$ is the **estimator**; the deterministic set $C(x)$ based on an observed value $x$ is the **estimate**."

A good estimator has small size (and hence gives a precise estimate of $\\theta$) and large confidence. However, for a given $X$, there is usually a tradeoff between confidence level and precision-increasing the confidence level comes only at the expense of increasing the size of the set, and decreasing the size of the set comes only at the expense of decreasing the confidence level. \n",

This set estimator has the best possible precision, but typically for continous distributions, would have confidence $0$. In between these extremes, hopefully, are set estimators that have high confidence and high precision."
