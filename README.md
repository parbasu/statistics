# Statistics 

Here you'll find some of my notes on statistics. The focus is on practical statistics. I don't provide any proofs, nor do I provide rigorous explanations as one would expect in a university math course. I might in the future. All the statistical tests and plots are done in Python. The notes are written in Jupyter Notebook.

The main references are:

I probably looked at some other books, but I can't remember at the moment. I also look for explanations on Mathematics Stack Exchange and [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/), but I can't link to every answer I found helpful. From now on, I'll make sure to bookmark.
